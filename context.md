## Comprehensive System Analysis: Automated Answer Sheet Evaluation System (AASES)

I've thoroughly analyzed your project and here's a complete context summary for implementing a similar system using Salesforce:

## **System Overview**
**AASES** is a sophisticated web-based educational assessment system built with Next.js that automates the evaluation of answer sheets using AI. It handles the complete lifecycle from question paper management to automated marking and result generation.

## **Core Architecture & Technology Stack**

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.2 with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Custom React components with Tailwind CSS
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with dark/light theme support
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)

### **Backend Architecture**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes (App Router)
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash model
- **OCR Integration**: Google Cloud Vision API

### **Key Dependencies**
- **@google/genai**: For AI-powered evaluation
- **@prisma/client**: Database operations
- **next-themes**: Theme management
- **class-variance-authority**: Component styling
- **lucide-react**: Icon system

## **Database Schema & Data Models**

### **Core Entities**

1. **AnswerSheet Model**
   - Stores raw student answers as text strings
   - Fields: rollNo (PK), name, slot, examType, totalMarks, answer1-answer10
   - Supports both CAT (5 questions) and FAT (10 questions) exam types

2. **MarkingSheet Model**
   - Stores evaluated marks as integers
   - Same structure as AnswerSheet but with numeric marks instead of text answers
   - Used for final evaluation results

3. **QuestionPaper Model**
   - Stores exam questions with metadata
   - Fields: subject, slot, courseCode, examType, question1-question10
   - Unique constraint on courseCode+slot+examType combination

4. **MarkingScheme Model**
   - Defines evaluation criteria and marks allocation
   - Fields: courseCode, slot, examType, mark1-criteria10
   - Links specific marking criteria to each question

### **Business Rules**
- **Exam Types**: CAT (Continuous Assessment Test) vs FAT (Final Assessment Test)
- **Slot System**: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2, E1, E2, F1, F2, G1, G2
- **Question Limits**: CAT uses questions 1-5, FAT uses 1-10
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevents duplicate papers/schemes for same context

## **System Features & Capabilities**

### **1. Question Paper Management**
- Upload and manage question papers by course, slot, and exam type
- Support for up to 10 questions per paper
- Question preview and management interface
- AI-assisted question paper generation using Gemini

### **2. Answer Sheet Processing**
- Display answer sheets in tabular format
- Filter by exam slots
- Support for both text and numeric answer formats
- Roll number-based unique identification

### **3. Marking Scheme Configuration**
- Define marking criteria for each question
- Allocate marks and specify evaluation criteria
- Course-specific marking schemes
- Flexible marking rules per question

### **4. AI-Powered Evaluation**
- Automated answer evaluation using Google Gemini
- Intelligent marking based on predefined criteria
- Preview evaluation results before finalization
- Support for subjective and objective questions

### **5. OCR Integration**
- Digitize physical answer sheets using Google Cloud Vision
- Extract text from scanned images
- Convert physical documents to digital format

### **6. Result Management**
- Generate marking sheets with evaluated scores
- Calculate total marks and percentages
- Visual progress indicators for evaluation
- Export and reporting capabilities

## **User Interface & Experience**

### **Main Dashboard**
- **Question Papers Section**: Expandable cards showing course details and questions
- **Marking Schemes Section**: Evaluation criteria management
- **Answer Sheets Table**: Raw student responses display
- **Evaluator Interface**: AI-powered evaluation preview
- **Marking Sheets Table**: Final evaluated results

### **Navigation & Layout**
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Clean, modern interface with gradient backgrounds
- Sticky navigation with settings dropdown

## **API Architecture**

### **Core API Endpoints**
1. **`/answers`**: Answer sheet CRUD operations
2. **`/question-paper`**: Question paper management
3. **`/marking-scheme`**: Marking criteria management
4. **`/ai`**: AI evaluation services
5. **`/api/vision-ocr`**: OCR processing

### **Data Flow Patterns**
- RESTful API design with JSON responses
- Query parameter-based filtering (slot, courseCode, examType)
- Error handling with structured error responses
- Real-time data fetching with loading states

## **AI Integration Strategy**

### **Gemini Integration**
- **Model**: gemini-2.0-flash-001
- **Purpose**: Automated answer evaluation and question generation
- **System Instructions**: Enforced code generation for database operations
- **Custom Prompts**: Configurable evaluation criteria

### **Evaluation Process**
1. Load question paper and marking scheme
2. Retrieve student answer sheet
3. Apply AI evaluation based on criteria
4. Generate marks breakdown
5. Calculate total scores
6. Store results in MarkingSheet

## **Salesforce Implementation Recommendations**

### **Recommended Salesforce Products**
1. **Salesforce Platform**: Core CRM for student and course management
2. **Education Cloud**: Specialized for educational institutions
3. **Einstein AI**: Native AI capabilities for evaluation
4. **Salesforce Connect**: External data integration
5. **Lightning Web Components**: Custom UI development

### **Data Model Mapping**
```
AnswerSheet → Education Cloud Student Assessment
QuestionPaper → Education Cloud Course Assessment
MarkingScheme → Education Cloud Assessment Criteria
MarkingSheet → Education Cloud Assessment Result
```

### **Implementation Approach**
1. **Custom Objects**: Create custom objects for each entity
2. **Lightning Flows**: Automate evaluation workflows
3. **Einstein Analytics**: Advanced reporting and insights
4. **Mobile App**: Salesforce mobile for field evaluation
5. **Integration APIs**: Connect with existing systems

### **Key Considerations**
